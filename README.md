During my project experience, I encountered significant challenges that tested both my technical skills and problem-solving abilities. One major hurdle was managing code scalability and flexibility as the application grew. Initially, maintaining straightforward functionality became cumbersome due to repetitive code and hard-to-manage logic. To address this, I adopted the Factory Pattern and inheritance, which played pivotal roles in restructuring the codebase.

Implementing the Factory Pattern allowed me to create a centralized way of generating objects without specifying their exact classes. This approach significantly improved the codeâ€™s modularity and readability by decoupling the object creation process from the main logic. It also streamlined the addition of new features, as new classes could be integrated seamlessly without altering existing code. The experience solidified my understanding of creating extensible and maintainable software architecture.

Inheritance, on the other hand, helped reduce code redundancy by enabling shared behaviors across related classes. By defining common attributes and methods in a base class and extending them in subclasses, I maintained cleaner, more efficient code that adhered to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.

Overall, these practices not only enhanced the scalability and flexibility of my project but also deepened my appreciation for design patterns. The process underscored the importance of planning a robust software structure from the outset to accommodate growth and ease future modifications.
